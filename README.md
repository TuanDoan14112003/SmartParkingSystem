# Smart Parking System
This project is an IoT-enabled Smart Parking System that uses sensors to automatically manage customers, monitor entries to the parking space and track the number of available parking slots without the need for human labour. Moreover, the system also comes with a web-based interface that allows the manager to see the customer list, analyze collected data, change the passcode for the parking space and interact with the physical devices in real-time. <p align="center">

The proposed system can be divided into 2 main units: the hardware and the software component. The hardware consists of every physical device including the microcontroller, the edge device, different sensors and actuators while the software part is made up of the web-based user interface and a MySQL database.<p align="center">
